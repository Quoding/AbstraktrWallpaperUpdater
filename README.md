# AbstraktrWallpaperUpdater
 A simple Windows (yikes) wallpaper updater that runs in the background and fetches the latest abstraktr.py image every 61 minutes.
 
## Disclaimer
 This is literally code I wrote in 30 minutes. It might skip on the 60th hour since the release of a new image doesn't seem exactly on time. No guarantees whatsoever, it is definitely ugly/trash code, but it gets the job done.
